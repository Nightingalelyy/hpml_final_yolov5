```
cd yolov5
pip install -qr requirements.txt

To start with our trained model weight, run the following command:

```
python detect.py --data data/mycoco.yaml --weight model_enhanced.pt --conf 0.25 --source data/videos/test_night_3.mp4
```

If you want to test your own video, place your video under data/videos, and change the name 'test_night_3.mp4' into your own video name
